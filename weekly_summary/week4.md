##  DeepMove
A sample 
![LSTM](../codes/DeepMove/codes/1.png)
I implement a LSTM model, it works quite well compared with RNN. But it is implemented without embedding layer.

I found it difficult to implement embedding layer (calculate gradient..). Could I use library Keras for embedding layer and dropout?


## Mobility Prediction
I start to work on this project, half done, but my virtual machine crashed. So I have to start from the begining.

## need to improve
I'm really sorry that I'm very busy this week. But I would have plenty of time in the following weeks.

And I intend to finish the coding part until next Wednesday.
